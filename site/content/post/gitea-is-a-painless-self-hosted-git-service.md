# What is Gitea?

Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Gitea is a fork of [Gogs](http://gogs.io). See the [Gitea Announcement](https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/) blog post to read about the justification for a fork.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across all platforms and architectures that Go supports. This support includes Linux, macOS, and Windows, on architectures like amd64, i386, ARM, PowerPC, and others.
